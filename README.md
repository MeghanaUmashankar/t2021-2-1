Programming language used: JAVA

Problem-1:
This program prompts the user to enter two numbers (a and b) and a choice (1-4) 
to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Problem-2:
Given an integer n, we need to repeatedly find the sum of its digits until the 
result becomes a single-digit number.

Problem-3:
If the input value 𝑎,a is considered odd, generate numbers starting from 1.
If the input value 𝑎,a is considered even, generate the first 𝑎−1.
The sequence always starts at 1 and progresses by incrementing by 2 (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...)

Problem-4:
The input list of numbers is represented as a List<Integer>.
After counting for a key, the result is stored in the map.
The map is printed, showing the counts of multiples for each key.
